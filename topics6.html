            <p class="description">
                A computer is an electronic device or machine that is capable of accepting data (input), computing and processing data according to specified rules, 
                creating information (output), and storing that information in various forms (Williams, 2021). The importance of computers to humans is exceptionally high. These 
                devices help us solve problems that we have faced since the time of invention. The word "computer" means something that computes for performing calculations automatically, 
                but today computers are more advanced and merely comparable to a calculator (Kanwal, 2024). In this present time computers are very important to people for everyday use. It 
                has been an essential part of every profession and important for gathering information, researching, and various activities.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Discussion</h2>
            <p class="description">
                There are different types of computers that are available these days. Each type varies in terms of functionality and data processing, 
                showing distinct features and output results. They also vary in different sizes, capacities, characteristics, purposes, and data-handling aspects.
                The actual machinery of computers is called hardware, while the instructions and data are called software. All general-purpose computers contain a CPU 
                (Central Processing Unit), memory, storage devices, input devices like a keyboard and mouse, and output devices like a monitor and printer. These components 
                enable the computer to work efficiently and perform tasks effectively. These components work together to process information, execute commands, and produce meaningful 
                results that users can understand and utilize. As technology is continuously getting better, computers become more powerful, compact, and efficient while continuously 
                performing a wide range of tasks within different fields of interest.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Comparison and Contrast</h2>
            <p class="description">Comparison and contrast of the following according to processing speed, memory capacity, power consumption, minimum and usage:</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 22px;">a. Mini Computer</h3>
            <p class="description">
                A minicomputer is a medium-sized system that falls between microcomputers and mainframes. 
                In comparison, a minicomputer provides a medium-scale processing speed in the range of hundreds to thousands 
                of MIPS, and memory from tens to hundreds of gigabytes; thus, it can support multiple users at the same time. 
                It consumes average power compared to larger ones and requires a stable environment with a multi-user operating 
                system like UNIX. Minicomputers are widely used in laboratory applications, small enterprise environments, and control systems 
                in industry due to their requirement of fast processing of data and shared access among many users.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 22px;">b. Micro Computer</h3>
            <p class="description">
                A microcomputer, which can be referred to as a PC, is designed for single use and much lower processing speed-2-4 GHz 
                with reduced memory capacity-8-64 GB in comparison with other kinds of computers, as mentioned by GeeksforGeeks 2025. Therefore, 
                much less power consumption-ranging between 50 to 300 watts-definitely makes it efficient because a lot of dollars are saved by 
                investing in a microcomputer. At the minimum, it requires a single-user operating system: either Windows, macOS, or Linux. Microcomputers
                are the major computers used in homes, offices, and schools for general purposes such as browsing, word processing, and entertainment, according to Linda 2024.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 22px;">c. Workstation</h3>
            <p class="description">
                A workstation is a single-user, high-performance computer with superior processing speed (3–5 GHz) and 
                large memory capacity (32–512 GB), suitable for professional applications. It requires moderate power consumption, 
                largely because of high-end CPUs and GPUs. However, in return, it provides very good computational performance, which
                can be applied in many specialized work roles. Among the minimum requirements, advanced cooling systems and strong components
                are inevitable to manage and execute resource-intensive software applications. Generally, workstations have traditionally been 
                placed within an engineering, animation, or computer-aided design (CAD) context where there was some need for precision and computing strength.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 22px;">d. Server</h3>
            <p class="description">
                A server is a multi-user system designed to handle multiple requests and provide services to other computers over a network. 
                It has high processing speed-2 to 4 GHz per core-and massive memory capacity, reaching up to hundreds of GB or even several TB to support 
                simultaneous operations (IBM, 2024). Because it operates for extended periods, often 24/7, its power consumption is higher than most computers; 
                it requires reliable cooling systems (U.S. Department of Energy, 2023). These have been applied in web hosting, database environments, and cloud 
                storage where large amounts of data have to be managed and the network ensured available, among others (Types of Computers, 2023).
