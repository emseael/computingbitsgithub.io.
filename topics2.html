                    Data are raw materials, much like a grain or metal ore. When it is allocated with relation to information, it can be synthesized into knowledge. Even though data has potential value it still needs refinement by collecting value in combination with other data (Hewitt, 2019).

                <h2 class="section-heading">Analysis</h2>
                <p class="description">
                    The idea of data, information, and information systems forms a hierarchy of utility in modeling modern organization companies. Data and information are tied together; you need a collection of data extracting its values and meaning to create information. Information is very important for an organization, as it provides meaning and patterns that guide planning and decisions. According to Batini and Scannapieco (2020), having information quality provides very structured data for analyzing situations for designing and planning, and also possessing quality data helps faster in processing and creating reliable information. Information, when applied, evolves into knowledge, being a foundation of strategic action. <br> <br>


            An information system is made for analyzing the quality of the information. Its foundation is to improve efficiency and productivity, by automating processes and reducing cost. Collecting, processing, and storing large amounts of data provides a proper decision making for the managers to create insight and timely decisions. IS facilitates proper communication and coordination for the organization's internal and external relationships, especially its partners, departments, customers, and collaborators. Having a well-designed IS gives you a competitive advantage being able to know the market trends, know customer demands, create new products and services. IS allows you to have better data management and security by providing robust tools ensuring integrity and accessibility of the data. Also, it gives business explore ideas and help in fundamentals of business functions like marketing, operations, finance, and human resource. <br> <br>
   
    Support Systems purpose is to facilitate informed decision making, enhanced efficiency, effective planning and management, and resource management. It helps in analyzing data, identifying trends, and predicting outcomes, that allows managers to be informed and create decisions. By reducing errors it betters the workflows to be more efficient and increases overall productivity. Support systems provide precise planning and insights that help the management in planning and implementing ideas and correcting the errors. The system identifies and solves complex problems, which gives the user information and analytical tools. It also helps distribute resources effectively, like marketing and human resourcing, which leads to an improvement in the organization's performance.<br> <br>


                In conclusion, these systems help the organization in allocating and properly gathering information and data. It processes raw data to actionable information reports, and enables analysis for scenarios, and offers guidance, and allows the user to solve problems effectively. These systems' coherence helps in organizational success.
