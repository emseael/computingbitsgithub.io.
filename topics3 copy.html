                    In computer ideology, number system is considered as a method or system of numbering that represent digits in the computer inner system (Mahat & Patil, 2020).

                <h3 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 24px;">1. BINARY NUMBER SYSTEM</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    Binary system base number is 2, because it has only two numbers the each represents the number value, which are 1 and 0. Binary is the number system from which the system accepts that process and store information (Olajide, 2017).
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 24px;">2. DECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    The decimal numbering system, also know as base 10, is the standard number system that the humans use for daily communication. It is composed of 10 digits ranging 0 to 9. In computing it holds a significant place for operations, data analysis, and majority of interactions as it is most natural and familiar to us (Hullat, 2023).
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 24px;">3. OCTAL NUMBER SYSTEM</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    The octal number system, as it reveals in its name octa meaning 8. It consist with 8 symbols, ranging 0 to 7. The main advantage of octal system is that in any digital transmission it can handle long strings of binary numbers. But sometimes it may also cause errors (Latif et al., 2011).
                </p>

                <h3 class="section-heading" style="font-size: 24px;">4. HEXADECIMAL NUMBER SYSTEM</h3>
                <p class="description">
                    The hexadecimal system is popular in computer uses. Its base number is 16 ranging form 1 to 15, but 10 to 15 is represented by alphabet letters (A=10), (B=11), (C=12), (D=13), (E=14), (F=15). Its main uses is to represent more numbers and represent large numbers with fewer digits (Latif et al., 2011).

                <p class="description">
                    According to the study of Robert (2022), the number system is a writing system for expressing numbers. It is a math notation that represents a set using digits or other symbols. In different systems, symbols might indicate different numbers. The number 11 in the decimal system is a normal number in everyday life, but in binary it represents 3, as it is used in computers for reading information and processing it. <br><br>
                    It helps to order efficiently the numbers in the computer system. It is easier to have a short list of characters that can take on different values depending on their position in the number (Gibson, 2021). The number system consists of binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal. The binary system is the primary fundamental language for all digital electronics and where all information is stored in computer memory. The two digits represent 0 and 1, which in the electrical circuit are on or off. The octal system's significance is that it has a more direct relationship with the binary system. In today's modern world it serves as a setting for file permissions in other operating systems. The decimal system is the standard system for human calculations globally. In non-computer measurements, like formulas and data analysis, we used the decimal system for human comprehension and communication. In computers we use binary internally, but the data we input and output that we see on screen is displayed in decimal for human comprehensibility. Last but not least, the hexadecimal system helps in making the long strings compact and shorthand. One hexadecimal digit perfectly represents four binary bits. It also helps in human interpretation and debugging more than long binary code. Also, it is frequently used in system programming, assembly, and debugging tools for clarity and precision. <br> <br>
                    In conclusion, the various system numbers serve a purpose that creates a necessary hierarchy for data management. They provide a very structured hierarchy that clarifies and simplifies the computation and definition. With these number systems, they serve an enduring clarity of the systems, providing precise, effective data processing for both human and computer contexts.
