                <p class="description">
                    Computer Science is a study of computation, algorithms, tackling theories, design, and development of hardware and software systems. It encompasses the scientific and practical aspects of algorithmic problem-solving processes, for which computational thinking skills and creative thinking are required (Hazzan et al., 2020).

                <p class="description">
                    Computer Science is more than just programming. It is about understanding how and why technology works, how data is processed, and how computations work. Its key aspects are made of Theoretical Foundations, Algorithms and Data Structures, Computational Solutions, Problem Solving and Design, and Artificial Intelligence Development (Denning, 1999).

                   Computer science as a discipline explores the theoretical aspects of computing and algorithm structure. As a discipline, it is one of the most dynamic and impactful fields in the modern world. What makes it unique is that it tackles both the theoretical and practical approaches, which means it's dual in nature. Contrarily, it relies on mathematics, logic, algorithms, and computing. On the other side, its concept helps in solving real-world problems by providing benefits in healthcare, business, education, and communication. This dual nature makes computer science have an important role in industries in how humans and technology work to create innovations in the real world. <br> <br>


                  Its very nature is to understand how technology works for the benefits of real-world application. Like, for example, in addition to diagnostics, predictive analytics built on AI helps in revolutionizing how our patients are treated and autonomous vehicles, which helps in optimization of traffic and logistics enhancement. <br> <br>
               
                The 5 computing disciplines and majors are computer engineering, computer science, information systems, information technology, and software engineering. They specialized in specific areas, but they are not isolated; rather, they complement one another. The computer engineer maintains and ensures the hardware can support advanced applications, while the software engineer may depend on the theoretical principles of computer science while also relying on IT infrastructure to deploy applications. On the other side, business relies on the information system to analyze, which is processed through software systems, which is handled by computer science. Based on this idea, these 5 principles and majors show the interconnection and collaborative effort in addressing complex problems. <br> <br>


         In conclusion, computer science as a discipline and alongside the 5 computing disciplines and majors is the pinnacle of technological advancement. As technology continues to evolve, the demand for computing expertise ensures that this discipline remains essential to shaping the future.
